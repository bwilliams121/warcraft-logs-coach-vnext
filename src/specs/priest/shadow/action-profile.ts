/**
 * The Shadow Priest reading of applicability and usability (ONB-D2).
 *
 * APPLICABILITY, IN THE PINNED ORDER. The domain boundary first (`domain-boundary.ts`). Then the
 * constructor readings: an action built on `spell_data_t::not_found()` is background
 * (action.cpp:541-549), and an untaken talent yields exactly that.
 *
 *     power_infusion, desperate_prayer, holy_nova, shadow_word_death, mind_blast, halo, voidform, shadow_word_madness, tentacle_slam, void_torrent
 *                          built on the talent of the same name (sc_priest.cpp and sc_priest_shadow.cpp, each constructor)
 *
 * Vampiric Touch, Shadow Word: Pain, Mind Flay, Mind Flay: Insanity, Void Volley and Void Blast are built on specialization spells or literal spells, with no
 * talent guard here.
 *
 * A READY() REFUSAL IS NOT APPLICABILITY. An action built on a literal spell whose `ready()` asks for a talent stays
 * applicable here, and that readiness is a usability claim this slice does not make. A talent proven not taken by the
 * resolved hero tree is background too. An UNKNOWN build fact never excludes anything.
 *
 * USABILITY: TWO PROOFS, AND NOTHING IN BETWEEN
 *
 *     SIMULATED_PREFIX_EXECUTION  this branch already fired the entry
 *     PROVEN_USABLE               the observed cast itself
 *
 * NOTHING ELSE. No cooldown is derived, no aura identity is pinned, and no resource is
 * reconstructed, so no ACTIVE_COOLDOWN, REQUIRED_AURA_INACTIVE or INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCE is
 * ever claimed, and no unobserved action is ever proven usable.
