/**
 * What Marksmanship Hunter supplies to the shared cast and channel anchor (ONB-D4, on ONB-S4).
 *
 * WHAT THE PROFILE PROVES, AND ONLY THAT. A hard cast has a cast time above zero, or this execution may have
 * been instant. It never gives a duration: `composite_spell_cast_speed()` at the cast is not established (a
 * combatant's pull stats are buffed values, and haste moves through the fight), so `exactMs` is always null and no
 * anchor is ever derived from a completion. A hard cast with no observable begin is UNKNOWN, never instant.
 *
 * A POSITIVE CAST TIME IS CLAIMED ONLY WHERE NO -100% ROW MATCHES THE SPELL (`hunter-marksmanship-cast-semantics.ts`).
 * Aimed Shot has one which this slice does not narrow, so it stays UNKNOWN on every build, and the shared
 * timeline keeps every placement that reading admits: a begin before such a completion may be an abandoned attempt, so it
 * is a candidate and never the moment.
 *
 * UNREVIEWED MEANS NOT REVIEWED. Exhilaration, Survival of the Fittest, Aspect of the Turtle, Aspect of the Cheetah, Disengage, Counter Shot, Mend Pet, the potion and the trinkets are outside the pinned rows. The profile says nothing about them,
 * the anchor reports EXECUTION_NOT_REVIEWED, and occupancy around one stays UNKNOWN.
 *
 * ONE CHANNEL IS REVIEWED, Rapid Fire (`channeled = true`, sc_hunter.cpp:5840). Its anchor is its cast, and its span is possible, never proven: a channel can be cancelled, as the list's own
 * `interrupt_if` does, and no bound is claimed.
