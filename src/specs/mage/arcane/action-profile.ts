/**
 * The Arcane Mage reading of applicability and usability (ONB-D3).
 *
 * APPLICABILITY, IN THE PINNED ORDER. The domain boundary first (`domain-boundary.ts`). Then the
 * constructor readings: an action built on `spell_data_t::not_found()` is background
 * (action.cpp:541-549), and an untaken talent yields exactly that.
 *
 *     arcane_missiles, arcane_pulse, arcane_orb, arcane_surge, evocation, presence_of_mind, touch_of_the_magi
 *                          built on the talent of the same name (sc_mage.cpp, each constructor)
 *
 * Counterspell, Arcane Blast and Arcane Barrage are built on class or specialization spells, with no talent guard. Prismatic Bolt is built on a literal spell, and its
 * `ready()` asks for its buff.
 *
 * A READY() REFUSAL IS NOT APPLICABILITY. An action built on a literal spell whose `ready()` asks for a talent stays
 * applicable here, and that readiness is a usability claim this slice does not make. A talent proven not taken by the
 * resolved hero tree is background too. An UNKNOWN build fact never excludes anything.
 *
 * USABILITY: TWO PROOFS, AND NOTHING IN BETWEEN
 *
 *     SIMULATED_PREFIX_EXECUTION  this branch already fired the entry
 *     PROVEN_USABLE               the observed cast itself
 *
 * NOTHING ELSE. No cooldown is derived, no aura identity is pinned, and no resource is
 * reconstructed, so no ACTIVE_COOLDOWN, REQUIRED_AURA_INACTIVE or INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCE is
 * ever claimed, and no unobserved action is ever proven usable.
