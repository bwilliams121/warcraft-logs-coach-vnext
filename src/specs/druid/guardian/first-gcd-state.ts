/**
 * The abstract state the Guardian Druid first-GCD query explores (ONB-T2).

 * The generic engine branches on every NON_GCD entry it cannot decide, executes it
 * hypothetically, and rescans from the root. It never reads the state; it keys it.
 *
 * It is a HYPOTHESIS, never an observation, and only a reviewed transition contract
 * (`druid-guardian-transition-authority.ts`) writes it: the authority entries that fired IN THIS
 * BRANCH, and nothing else, because no contract here writes anything else.
