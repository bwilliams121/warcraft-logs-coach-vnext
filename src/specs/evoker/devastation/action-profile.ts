/**
 * The Devastation Evoker reading of applicability and usability (ONB-X2).
 *
 * APPLICABILITY, IN THE PINNED ORDER. The domain boundary first (`domain-boundary.ts`). Then the
 * constructor readings: an action built on `spell_data_t::not_found()` is background
 * (action.cpp:541-549), and an untaken talent yields exactly that.
 *
 *     dragonrage, eternity_surge, pyre, quell, tip_the_scales, verdant_embrace
 *                          built on the talent of the same name (sc_evoker.cpp, each constructor)
 *
 * Azure Strike, Disintegrate, Fire Breath, Hover and Living Flame are built on class spells, Emerald Blossom on a literal spec spell, and Azure Sweep and Unbound Flame on literal spells whose
 * `ready()` asks for a buff. None has a talent guard. Deep Breath and Disintegrate fall to `not_found()` only with Breath of Eons and Eruption, Augmentation's talents, which no Devastation tree holds.
 *
 * A READY() REFUSAL IS NOT APPLICABILITY. An action built on a literal spell whose `ready()` asks for a talent stays
 * applicable here, and that readiness is a usability claim this slice does not make. A talent proven not taken by the
 * resolved hero tree is background too. An UNKNOWN build fact never excludes anything.
 *
 * USABILITY: TWO PROOFS, AND NOTHING IN BETWEEN
 *
 *     SIMULATED_PREFIX_EXECUTION  this branch already fired the entry
 *     PROVEN_USABLE               the observed cast itself
 *
 * NOTHING ELSE. No cooldown is derived, no aura identity is pinned, and no resource is
 * reconstructed, so no ACTIVE_COOLDOWN, REQUIRED_AURA_INACTIVE or INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCE is
 * ever claimed, and no unobserved action is ever proven usable.
